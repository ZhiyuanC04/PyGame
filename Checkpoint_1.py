# We want to make a game like the Jump king. The character jumps from platform to platform and there will be
# stars for him to collect and time count-up. The game end when the character falls out of the screen.

# Three Basic Features:

# 1. User Input:
# Keyboard input as the character in the game is moved by "AWSD" and "Space". R for restart.

# 2. Game Over:
# The game over when the character falls out of the screen.

# 3. Graphics/Images:
# Image of the character. And the character should change--become more handsome--after collecting some stars.
# You jump higher as well when collecting more stars.

# Four Additional Features:

# 1. Restart from Game Over:
# Press "R" to restart the game.

# 2. Collectibles:
# The stars in the game. The character jumps higher and become more handsome after collecting some stars.

# 3. Timer
# A count-up to show how long the character survives.

# 4. Two players simultaneously
# We will have two mode. One for single player only and the second one for two players. Single player mode is for
# surviving longer time, and two player mode is competition of who dies faster. (there can be a health-bar for two
# player mode to provide more chance. Character dies when no more health.)
